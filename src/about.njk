        Static Webcomic Site Generator is a tool that allows cartoonists to quickly and easily create a website to share their work. It's built using 11ty. This "About" page is where the cartoonist would write about themselves and their project. The rest of this page is written by A.I. It's basically Lorem Ipsum. It is NOT an accurate description of the project. For more about the project, see <a href="https://github.com/stephensavoia/swcsg">GitHub</a>.
